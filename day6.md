Byron's Trial, Day 6 (Week 2)
=============================

(Detective-Sergant Bui arrives with 3 banker boxes)

* Female prosecutor is not present (sick?) and is the one more with Oullet's report.
* Prosecution doesn't plan to go through picture by picture -- he isn't entirely sure what his partner planned to do.
* Prosecution is prepared to talk about police statements.
* Prosecution: If Defense and prosecution could talk, we may be able to thin things out.
* Judge comments on how optimistic 

* Judge: Yesterday it became apparent there was a misunderstanding between counsel and the court. ... No releif was sought in the alternative of quashing. I determined that after excision in amplification, the issuing judge could have issued on the first offense. No further consideration was needed. Prosecution and Counsel seemed to understand that every point needed to be addressed. This was not mentioned in the warrant. 

* Judge: I've concluded that both warrants stand with respect to the first charge. I will need to hear further on the second charge. Prosecution conceded that the third charge was not supported and I agree. I could hear further submissions on adding attempted mischeif. While I don't agree that Mr. Sonne needed to know who was involved, there was no evidence of an agreement with anyone -- so it should not have been issued. So there shouldn't have been grounds for searching for items related to co-conspirators. There were grounds to search for items relating to mischeif, wave guide... [Judge is going far too fast for me to get everything] If we need my full reasons, we will need to adjourn for some time.


* Defense: [Arguments I intended earlier, but feel compelled to make] I made both facial and subfacial attacks. My understanding of what a facial attack -- one would compare the face of the warrant and compare it the face of the ITO, and see if they matched. ... It does not fall to the defense to seek another remedy. The warrant is quashed until the Prosecution would seek severability to save parts of the warrant. ... There is also the point of the prosepctive nature of the warrant -- this type of warrant can only apply to completed offense, which needs to defend... 

* Judge: I considered the issue of excision. ... I concluded to that the warrant can be issued on the first point ...

* Defense: If you find that on a facial review -- not subfacial! -- then it needs to 

* Judge: ...

* Defense: It was my position that the minute the misalignment was found the warrant was dead.

* Judge: You're arguing that if one point fails (prosecution interjects: on facial issues) that the warrant fails.

* Defense: Was the first account found to be a completed or ...?

* Judge: A completed and continuing...

* Judge: We need to hear submissions on what the impact of my ruling is.

* Defense: There may be an addtional issue. [pause to whisper] I'm hesitatnt to ask, but I will. I would like to ask for understanding: I read the first count as listed in appendix B, it relates to, it reads as threatening to destroy property of a justice system participant.

* Judge: No, I've considered it. Had I concluded differently, my ruling would have been different. ... What is the position of the prosecution?

* Prosecution: If the proescution and defense could talk for half an hour, and then we could try to deal with scheduling.


(30 minute break)
o apply
* Defense: We will start tomorrow with our statements and have our evidence put together... We think it will take 2 or 3 days, before the multiplier. In relation to what happens with the search warrant. We agree that a lot hangs on your honors ruling. For the crown to decide to request severability... We will really need to see your reasons. So we will adjourn for today and begin again tomorrow.

* Judge: Are there other statements made that will effect the search? Except the issue with the cottages which has already been conceded

* Defense: If severability occurs, then manner of search issues may become live.
* Judge: Any other issues?
* Defense: The admissibility of an expert witness of the crown... Not an issue for us
* Judge discusses time in fourth week. Time estimates have been wildly inacurate.
