Byron's Trial, Day 7 (Week 2)
=============================

* Judge: It would be nice if Prosecution & Defense could anticipate needing to talk in advance...
* Prosecution: There are a couple of things in the evidence that should not be a matter of public record. I'm being cryptic intentionally, and I'll let my friend elaborate. We are both in agreement that it should not go in the public domain. So we made need to make a minor edit... If we can locate it in the transcript, police video service can edit the video. And the transcript should be black marker redacted.
* Defense gives page number to edit out.
* Judge looks at it to make sure that there will not be a problem.

(15 minute break that takes much longer -- while they redact film?)

* Prosecution intends to call witnesses Sergeant Penton (arrested Mr. Sonne) officer John Donlaw (sp?) out of order... Six witnesses.

  * Mazared Maadenian will speak
  * Detective Shane-Hill

* Defense within this context, there is no objection to torontogoat's tweets being Mr. Sonne

* Maadenian sworn in

* Judge: When was the will-say prepared?
   * Monday
* Judge: You looked at your notes?
   * Yes.
* Judge: If there is no object to D, you are free to refer to your notes.
* Defense: No issue.
* Judge: Please tell us if you refer to your notes.
* Prosecution: What unit?
 * Detective
* What in June?
 * 
* Special duties
 * Intelligence.
* Became aware of Sonne?
 * Yes.
* Explain your duties with regard to Sonne and his home?
 * I was aware of Mr. Sonne leading up to it.
 * I was told that morning that it was possible the search warrant would be executed. 
 * Discussion of rules, superies.
 * Normal day until 
 * Once the search warrant was signed, we were going to arrest Mr. Sonne.
 * He was supposed to be arrested before the search warrant was executed.
   * Because of explosives and chemicals, we wanted to arrest him for public safety, safety of officers, and to a lesser extent destruction of evidence.
 * Not involved in arrest
 * Told Penton that under no circumstance was Mr. SOnne to have access to a phone.
  * Not specific to lawyers
  * Because it is possible that explosives could be set of remotely.
  * Not sure about explosives going in.
  * Not time limited, but until further notice.
 * Did not have any part after his arrest, did not give further notice.
 * Did not know who took over.

Prosecution: No further question.

Defense: Is it detective or sergeant.
 * Detective.
 * Defense: Concern about explosives in the house before the warrant was executed. you were made of this before?
   * Not sure if I was made aware after or before, but we were concerned... because of things we found on the internet
 * Concerned about the kinds of 
 * Definitely had concerns prior.
 * Defense clarifies many times.
 * Defense: Briefings?
   * Not part of the warrant team.
 * But as part of surveillance team?
   * ..
 * Did you read the ITO?
   * No.
 * Advised?
   * No.
 * Briefing on the day of the arrest?
   * Not part of that.
 * Directed on a surveillance issue that day?
 * Advised about potential of arrest?
   * Yes.
 * Charges?
   * To be charged for intimidation and mischief.
 * Details? Further information?
   * Just that it had to do with the G20
 * Didn't see internet postings?
   * No.
 * Told about pictures of fence... 
   * Yes.
 * And that was it?
   * Yes... Actually, I made have heard about the potato cannon.
 * You weren't directing the arrest.
   * yes.
 * You just happened to be the arresting team? Could have been another?
   * Yes.
 * But you decided to not give him access to a phone.
   * Not by myself. Made that decision in consultation with Supermarang (sp?)
 * You considered the speaking to lawyer issue?
   * Yes.
 * This was a deliberate decision?
   * Yes.
 * Supermarang wasn't a superior officer.
   * Yes.
 * Didn't consider letting him just speak to a lawyer?
   * No.
 * The decision was clear, we won't let him speak to a laywer ...
   * yes.
 * Because of concern about explosives and chemicals, you don't let him speak to anyone?
   * And because of concerns about destruction of evidence.
 * This is standard?
   * At least in the drug squad that I'm part of.
 * First step in search warrant is to secure premise.
 * Triggered the arrest.
 * You know that the location is going to be secured, and know where Mr. Sonne is and once you arrest him you know he isn't there.
 * Presumably no one shows up at the house?
   * Well, they may.
 * But you don't let them reach the house.
   * Yes.
   * But it is more complicated than that...
 * If I told you that there was no mention of chemicals or explosives in the warrant?
   * I didn't read the warrant.
 * But you you were concerned about explosives before hand. 
   * That is my recollection.
 * Destruction was a lesser concern than destruction of evidence?
   * Secondary, yes
 * What is the concern about destruction of evidence, once the premise is concerned.
   * I don't know what they found.
   * I don't know what you mean by secured.
   * They backed off once they found the explosives. I don't know what time that we weren't concerned about touching chemicals, for example.
 * What was the concern about lawyers?
   * Not just a lawyer.
   * No way to prevent lawyer from calling someone else. But I won't speculate.
 * Presumably a lawyer would detective themselves in accordance with the law and ethics codes?
   * I won't speculate.
 * Once the premise was secured?
   * And I wasn't the one who made the decision after it was secured?
 * Who should I ask?
   * I'm not privy to that knowledge.
 * You sent someone to the station for Mr. Sonne's arrival, a person from intelligence.
   * To help answer any questions Mr. Sonne might have.
 * You were seconded to G20 security, though you were part of intelligence?
   * Yes [with some discussion I didn't catch]
 * Only gave telephone restriction to Penton?
   * Yes.
 * Because he was the arresting officer?
   * Or someone under his command.

Prosecution:

  * Was the explosives the only reason you restricted telephone use?
    * It's standard, even when we don't know what they could find, for officer safety. And concerns about destruction of evidence.

  * quarter to two.
* Spoke to Sergeant Penton
* Went to see him right away.
* First time I met him, I introduced myself, asked who he was to make sure he was the correct person, and asked if he wanted anything and got him a drink.
* Went on computer system to gather information.
* Why? To assess access points and understand his background.
* Went alone to ask if he needed food or to use the washroom. He didn't need anything
* At 4:05 we went to see him, and Shanehill was introduced and I reintroduced myself. We went to see if it was worth our time to talk to him or if he'd say to fly a kite.

  * He seems intelligent. 
  * Never told that he had no choice answer questions.
  * Never told him that he didn't need to answer questions.
  * Were you concerned that Mr. Sonne was intimidated, frightened, or unable to refuse to respond?
    * That's a question you should ask Mr. Sonne. That wasn't the impression I got.
  * Was he a candidate for an informant?
   * Didn't know about those groups, so he investigated hacklab, surveillance group

 * I don't understand
* Did you consider that if he wasn't good as an informant, you might use what he said as evidence against him?

* Conference passes. (Bui: "Blank passes, pre-used passes")

"You're making a pie, making a Byron shit-pie out of a bunch of things that are legal"

" I can't help what other people think. You're just doing your job and I'm just living my life. I'm trying to get the licenses and follow the rules to ...."

"But combined those could make a bomb? Yeah, but so could your car and a match."

Bui tries to get Byron to admit to wanting to make a bomb many times.

Bui claims that Byron earlier told him that he'd admitted to having a detonator, when the video clearly show that he didn't.

Movie stops at 43:46.
