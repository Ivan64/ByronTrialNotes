This week began the voir dire of Byron's trial by Judge before Justice Nancy Spies -- the stage of the trial in which the admissibility of the evidence is assessed. In particular, this week was a Garofoli hearing regarding the warrant for Byron's house and its successor.

It is not an appeal, so it is assumed that the issuing Justice made the correct decision in signing the affidavit as it was given -- such an appeal could only be made after the trial, as Canada doesn't allow interlocutory appeals. Instead, the question is whether the warrant remains valid after we remove incorrect, misleading, or charter-violatingly obtained evidence.

Primarily, the argument has been a paragraph by paragraph analysis of the affidavit or ITO (the document that became the warrant when it was signed), with the defense arguing that many of these paragraphs need to be excised (cut out of the warrant), and, moreover, that they were intentionally misleading or made in bad faith. The prosecution has conceded a number of points, but is still trying to argue that all mistakes were made in good faith. An overarching theme of the prosecution's argument has been that officer French, the author of the affidavit, was an extremely poor writer, rushed for time, and didn't mean many of the things he wrote.

Whether the warrant was made in good or bad faith is important for a number of reasons, the most immediate of which is that the prosecution can try to fix good-faith removals with amplification, a process by which other information known to the police at the time can be injected into the warrant. Amplification is intended to prevent a minor technical error from ruining a warrant.

So far, the only ruling the judge has made is a minor point about when Byron's detention began in the jaywalking incident: when the ruse began, as the prosecution had already conceded. Over the weekend, the judge is working on assessing the content of the affidavit, but doesn't expect to have a complete decision for Monday. One is hopeful that she will have decisions about some parts of the affidavit.

Next week, there will be arguments specific to the seizure of computers at Byron's house, whether the affidavit stands after the Judge's decision and amplification, and, if the affidavit still stands, a second argument to quash it pursuant to section 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That will conclude the voir dire, and we will move on to the main portion of Byron's trial.
