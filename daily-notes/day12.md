Byron Trial Notes, Day 12 (Week 3)
==================================

**Summary:** Defense continues arguing that rights abuses make the statements Byron made in custody inadmissible. Prosecution argues against, in particular suggesting that the rights violations were mitigated by Byron's legal knowledge.

********

Judge: Defense has an hour an half to finish submissions.

* The court can conclude no relevant evidence would have been had from the formality of asking Hill & Garrow from the balance of evidence.
* It's not a circumstance, in this case, where the court should be concerned and unfairness to the witnesses or the Crown. The contradiction is in the very statement the Crown wishes to tender and was given notice in our submission...
  * The Crown's failure to call any witness who report to be calling the shots... If adverse inferences should be drawn, it should be against the Crown for not calling witnesses within their control. But I think that adverse inferences shouldn't be used, unless as a last resort
* Circumstantial evidence that...
* The circumstances of Mr. Sonne's comments -- spontaneous, detailed, and without much knowledge.... At what point would Mr. Sonne have had an opportunity to conclude that making false claims about Hill & Garrow's conduct...
* The seriousness of this issue here, but that doesn't change on the seriousness.
* Voluntariness must be shown beyond a reasonable doubt.
* Other issues, such as tainting and 24(2) will require findings.
* "There is only one standard of proof, and that is proof on balance of probabilities"
* Microwave control panel: this makes little context in the context of the blog, if Mr. Sonne is being asked what he likes to build, but if he is shown pictures and asked to identify their contents...
* Social groups Mr. Sonne is a part of -- most of which they haven't heard of.
* Judge: That could be them asking about conspiracy, but that also makes sense with their stated purpose...
* If this were a pretext, the the conspiracy in the search warrant, and I'm mindful of you honor's ruling, may be a pretext
* Hill mentions going back to information person.
* Garrow decides Mr. Sonne is not a good potential CI. Doesn't say anything.
* Confidentiality is implicit in source management... says that he tells potential source about confidentiality.
* Information won't be used about the investigation...
* My friend asked if the confidentiality was reversible and they say they hadn't intended to.
* Two alternative theories:
  * Pretext arrest
  * Ruse interrogation
* Warrant was overly broad, extends beyond what is...
* Mr. Sonne arrested for lesser charges than those in the warrant.
* Unusual and unsupportable no-calls-order.
* Violation of counsel rights, which would be useful if this is the case.
* Judge: Ruse interrogation?
* Pretext arrest. Counsel can screw up...
* Hill & Garrow say they were only there for investigation, if it was a pretext arrest that is true.
* No person for investigation for first 12 hours.
* No plan for interrogation.
* A fair reading of the blog would suggest that the wave guide was disassembled, didn't work, stored away and nothing...
* Whether it is a real concern or an overstated concern...
* They find chemicals, and they realize that things are more seriously...
* Mr. Sonne fits the profile of someone with a lot to loose... Married, in an middle class home...
* Judge: This would be at odds with my previous findings...
* As a way of testing the pretext theory, is it consistent with how things unfold... If this was supposed to just be a quick search to get waveguide.
* Statement that HTMD was found, mistake belief that thermocouple is a detonator. They they have to shift gears..
* So Bui is parachuted in. His unit had volunteered to handle ...
* Does it make sense that they would drill into Mr. Sonne how bad things look to...
* The alternative theory is the ruse theory: These two detectives go in and abuse a hallowed privilege that exists and is so important to the work. And they do pass on the information, but it must have been clear that the problems would arise...
* Issue of chemicals result. Hill goes to get information. Hill doesn't clarify his changed role.
* Right to silence. If Mr. Sonne was denied a meaningful choice with them coming in and talking about the investigation when Mr. Sonne not knowing...

* Tilly contacting... Verify Kevin's identity twice.
* Finally gets in to contact.
* Bui wanted to build rapport
* Gives cautions off the top of his head, to keep things conversational.
* Secondary caution says that it was that he didn't have to say anything.
* Mr Byrne asked if there was anything about the effect of speaking to other officers, and Bui said no.
* Purpose of secondary caution is break the link between previous statements and the present one.
  * Not intuitive.
* Asked about, in the wording of the secondary caution, whether his testimony was influenced by speaking to police officers, and it took a number of queries to get him to pick it up.
* Judge: What did Dumlaw say?
  * First said it was from a notebook.
  * Then said.
  * Says "caution", not "cautions"
* Detective Bui is clearly a very professional officer:
  * For example, the importance of following procedures with....
* Detective Bui refused to admit the obvious about his second interview with Byron: submit a reasonable explanation that Kristen goes free. He is unreliable at least as regards..
* Since the only evidence regarding the secondary caution is his word, this casts doubt.
* This feeds into voluntariness.
* Interrogation after 24 hours, before Mr. Sonne is brought before a judge. No rights or charters. 
* Mr. Sonne doesn't recall Bui... It's not surprising that he doesn't recall the under ten minutes spent on rights, charges and cautions after 24 hours of detention.
* No reminder, even by reference... nothing to advise him about the lack of interest of Garrow and Hill.
* Nexus between these events, causal connection... Temporal connection, since it is still one chunk of detention.
* "How do I know you aren't just going to use this to build up a case against me?" How do I know this isn't some sort trick? Links to Hill and Garrow, and in fact that's exactly what they did. This cries out for the repetition of cautions...
* If there's uncertainty about the second caution, even if it was given 12 hours ago, it should be given..
* There is an offer of a legal benefit for his wife.
* Judge: Mr. Sonne seems to have understood that he couldn't.
  * It's problematic that he puts it out there
  * Promise of favor doesn't have to be a guarantee of a result
  * There's influence.
* Judge: Do any of your cases deal with the distinction between the guarantee of a result in comparison to favor?
  * No. We could dig some up for you...
* A clear threat of prejudice.
* Precedent talks about clear offer of an exchange.
* The issue of oppression. Brings Mr. Sonne to feeling like he's going to vomit. And when Mr. Sonne expresses concern about security ticket, he gives a promise to try and prevent being pulled out of the proper legal system.
  * Bui said he wasn't surprised ...
* No rechartering at the beginning of the second interrogation.
* Novel aspect is that status changed from lawful to unlawful detention, does that reengage 10(b)? This relates to Bui sending away counsel.

(break 20 min)

* Crown was supposed to provide written response to Counsel, before Counsel was done.

Prosecution response:

* It is important to understand Mr. Sonne's state of mind before he was arrested. What was his state of knowledge? 
* Judge: I don't think the situation of the detainee is that important. If Mr. Di Luca was arrested, he'd still need rights & caution.
* Well, I'm starting with the assumption that there was a breach...
* But I don't think there's a problem with the statement to Hill & Garrow.
* Judge: I'd understood you conceded it...
* ..
* Judge: Are you saying that it was fine for Hill & Garrow to speak to Mr. Sonne, save for the Counsel issue.
* It's our position that there is no anything wrong with what they did.
* Judge: Then why did you concede it.
* It is our position that statement wasn't ever intended to be used as evidence.
* As Counsel conceded, sometimes we need to wait with putting people in contact with the outside world.
* Judge: But once the premises were secured? And what about confirming Mr Tilly was a lawyer.
* Mr. Tilly might have gone and made an innocent call to family and it could still end up being harmful. Officer safety.
* Judge: But once the premise is secured?
* There were concerns about explosives.
* Judge: How is that relevant, once the premise is secured? Unless your suggesting it could be triggered by somebody, and there's not evidence of that.
* Yes, well, we conceded that at some point it become a breach.
* But I think the important point is to understand his knowledge about legal issues. He's fairly sophisticated. He's studied these issues in more depth than we expect from the average person.
* The day before, less than 24 hours before his arrest, Mr. Sonne tweeted "read all these documents, know your rights..." for the movement defense committee. This goes into details about his rights, in particular, that he didn't have to answer questions and had a right to a lawyer.
  * When can the police arrest you? Goes into detail
   * I submit that this is all legally accurate and correct information.
  * Goes into 10(b)
* Says that it is not giving them legal advice... "This is like when we go to a part as a judge or a lawyer and someone asks us what they should do, we say ..."
* Judge: It is puzzling that he would answer "no" when Bui asks about him knowing his rights...
* Well, we're not arguing that they didn't have to give him his rights.
* But this knowledge profoundly mitigates the effect of the charter breach.
* "The purpose of 10(b) is provide ... with information ... the most important things is that the accused understands their rights..."
* 10(b) and right to silence protect you knowing your rights, but not to make intelligence decisions about them.
* Judge: But if Mr. Sonne had been given his rights, he would have been given advice on how to exercise his rights. And they would have been able to give advice on Hill & Garrow.
*..
* Judge: Are you saying that if he had spoken to counsel he wouldn't have spoke to Hill & Garrow.
* No....
* Judge: But I'm being asked to consider voluntariness of Hill & Garrow. I can't just skip over it because you aren't using it.
* No, but if they had given him immediate counsel he wouldn't have discussed Hill & Garrow. because they hadn't been introduced yet.
* And the important thing is Mr. Sonne's understanding of his rights.
* "I submit that Mr. Sonne was no worse off for not speaking to Counsel..."
* In car, we saw Mr. Sonne wasn't given the second caution. But that was the first officer he spoke to, so it didn't make sense.
* We have the evidence of Officer Dunlaw ... Mr. Sonne says "Wishes to engage in silence, that was the advice of my lawyer and that's what I wish to do".
* The Crown's position on Hill & Garrow is that what the thing appears to be is what it is. Hill & Garrow are sent to go seem him to consider whether he is an appropriate source. This is different than Counsel, which suggests that he was being recruited.
* Since they weren't looking for information about him, there was no violation of the obligation to hold up.
* There was no issue of voluntariness here, since there's no quid pro quo. Neither where there was a trick.
* There was no promise of confidentiality, there was a use description.
* My friend says this was all going to be confidential, but it is problematic. 
* Even if there had confidentiality, it could have been shared within the police and Crown...
* If the other police officers weren't able to access the intelligence they gather, what's the point.
* All there was was a use description.
* Judge: So you're saying the could go in, ask questions and go tell the investigating officers...
* False analogy to solicitor-private privilege. Solicitor privilege protects everything says. The only information protected in CI privilege when protecting identity.
* Judge: What does use against mean?
* Tender.
* "The police know all kinds of things about all kinds of people that will never see the light of day in a courtroom. That doesn't mean that they don't have a right to know?"
* "My friends hasn't asked Mr. Sonne..."
* Judge: Won't be used against you, but they go outside and tell investigating officer?
* Mr. Sonne's intelligence...
* "No reason for any basis to be made in the absence of Mr. Sonne testifying."
* Judge: But is there some case law that is the basis that they could go in for intelligence, and not give counsel because they don't investigate, and go tell results. Isn't there some obligation to mention that, hey, we won't tender this in a court but if the investigating officers are hanging around outside, we can go tell them.
* ...
* Judge: I find that very disturbing... It sets up the potential for a lot of abuse... Who would speak to intelligence officer in those circumstances? ... Shouldn't there be some evidence before me...
* It would be unreasonable to assume that they were just asking for their curiosity.
* Judge: Accepting your position that they went in legitimately... either your saying that he should have assumed but... it totally hollows out the section 10 rights.
* Mr. Sonne is aware he doesn't have to speak to any officers. That's the ultimate result.
* Judge: except that there ...
* I don't accept that they said they knew nothing.
* ..
* And even if you don't accept that, "it's just part of the breach of the duty to hold off."

(Lunch)

* Counsel takes the position that there's no one was in charge. 
* In fact, the investigators were investigating the house.
* Judge: I understood the emergency task force was doing that?
* They were just thee to make it safe.
* Judge: Who was in charge?
* ...
* Judge: Who was n charge?
* Well, on its face there appears to not be someone. My friend wants you to believe that then Hill & Garrow were.
* Judge: I don't know that that's what they were arguing...
* I admit someone dropped the ball at some point.
* There's no inference that this gap means that there is a conspiracy. It's speculative. 
* Doesn't even rise to the level of a reasonable doubt.
* My friend finds it suspicious that Hill & Garrow go in every hour on the hour. 
* I don't believe that they said they knew nothing in advance. 
* Mr. Sonne knowing what he's posted on the Internet is trying to give an innocuous explanation...
* No one can answer that.
* These loose ends are a sign of truth. If they wanted to deceive ...
* Counsel didn't ask them about this.
* Voluntariness is the Crown's onus. 
  * An explanation, as in a trial, must have an air of reality... Just anything isn't capable of rasing a reasonable doubt.
* My friends position on witnesses is backwards. Since when do we get to assume...
* If it is implicit, then I agree.
* The officers might give an explanation.

* What is the actual effect of going past 24 hours?
* There's no effect on Mr. Sonne.
* It's not the case that he was going to be released.
* No responsible bail hearing without...
* Not a serious charter problem.
* I don't think it's arbitrary...
* If it is a breach of section 9, then it is a very minor and technical.
* There's no need for a remedy.
* A fresh 10(b) right because of this is contrary to the spirit of the law. 
* Remember that this is about if the a minimal charter rights.

* There is no hard and fast rule that you must video tape a statement.
* No video tape, but thee is an adequate record. 
* To suggest that Bui didn't know the second caution...
* Dumlaw was clearly a fair witness.
  * Judge: did he have notes?
* Not on that specifically, "given caution"?
* The most important thing is the primary caution. The secondary caution is just a supplement.
* Judge: If there was some sort of confidentiality...
* ...
* Mr. Sonne saying he doesn't want to talk must end any tainting argument.
* "How do I know you're not just using this to build up a case against me." Out of context that needs some explanation.
* Mr. Sonne is smart, he knows what he's posted, he knows what he's charged with, he know his house has been searched, he understands the context. 
* He understands that he isn't just giving intelligence. 
* Mr. Sonne is clearly aware that he has a right to not answer. 

* The main concern seems to be that bringing up Kristen's bail conditions make things involuntary.
* Precedent: Two people are accused with murder. Police persuade one that knows the other is innocent...
* It's just a bail hearing. It's not like she was going to be locked up for life.
* Even if there was an inducement, it wasn't taken. 
* statement is repleat 
* Judge: I could excise only a portion of the statement.
* Judge: at some point...
* As long as Mr. Sonne is exercising the freedom to choose...

* Security ticket in second statement: my view is that this concern eliminates from Mr. Sonne. The police can't be saddled with it. And Bui's promise is not a quid pro quo promise.
* He clearly still understands that he doesn't have to answer everything.

* Comment with respect to 503, superior court case Meghan, trial judge had stayed something, and the ... the very reason they weren't put in front of the court was to give the impression he isn't going anywhere...

* I'd say that when Bui arrived and gives his charter warning, that was a fresh start.
* Judge: The one that we don't have on tape?
* It's corroborated by Dumlaw.

* Mr. Sonne is not trying to respond to things in the previous statements. He's not trying to dig himself out of a whole.

* Mr. Sonne had the opportunity to rest a bit.

* If your honor finds an voluntariness issue, it doesn't immediately domino.

* Regarding 24(2), even if the Crown is wrong and there is a taint in one or more of the subsequent statement,...
* Judge: All the statements of fact are important.
* Mr. Sonne's intelligence, sophistication and lack of intimidation...

* When the phone call comes from Gibson about explosives, all bets were off. The only concern is public safety. Everything yields, including 10(b).

* The more severe state misconduct, the greater the need for the court to disassociate itself.

* "This case is largely about intent..."

* To what extent did the breach of the charter undermine the rights of the accused?

* This is one of those rare cases, where, even if there is a breach by tainting, the taint is so diffuse...

Rebuttal by counsel:

* The Crown presents a very impoverished view of the right to Counsel -- par24, "relevant to his legal situation". My friends present that he would have had a talk with counsel, heard about 10(b) right to silence, and things would have gone on the same way. But Sinclair goes on with categories that require counsel again, "the categories are not closed, however additions are necessary to preserve 10(b)". Non-routine procedures, like polygraphs, are not anticipated and new consultation with counsel is necessary...

* Use immunity would certainly need advice and wouldn't be in pamphlets.

* A change in detainment from lawful and unlawful falls into the same category.

* My friend presents a contractual interpretation of informant counsel. A deal of offering and acceptance. It would deter people from coming forward. There is a very strange position coming from the Crown.
  * Similarly, a very broad interpretation of what falls under protecting the identity.

* Litigation risk in them adding the statement of Byron. 

* My friend called described my theory as a conspiracy theory. My friend is saying that, for a few hours, that there was no plan. But Hill & Garrow, were going in, and were not interrupted. Bui talked about the amount of planning that goes into an arrest... 

* My friend describes 503 as a technicality... But if he'd had access with a lawyer, family, better access to the outside, my friend would tell us that that was the clear break...

* My friend says the inducement was never acted upon. But it clearly was, first the "it was just a joke", purchases, location of purposes, times of purposes...
  * I agree that if it such the internal involuntariness, it would be necessary to find the point are...
  * I suspect my friend would find evidentiary value in the responses to the inducements themselves, that they suggest there was more to say.

* Detective Bui links interviews at points, too. And the subject matter overlaps.
