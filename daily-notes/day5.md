Byron's Trial, Day 5 (Week 2)
=============================

**Summary:** Judge dismisses the motion regarding the warrant on the grounds that she found one charge that survived. From there, a brief legal debate ensued, leaving it clear that some party was confused. An hour in, court was adjourned until the next day.

(Defense and Crown talking for half an hour)

(Judge has read written submission by Defense)

* Decision on quashing warrant. After consideration, Judge has decided to dismiss the motion. She will provide written reasons.
* Next motion is the computer search. 
* Judge wants to keep the trial moving
* Defense thinks evidence from Officer Roulet is important.
   * Harddrive is a vast amount of information.
   * If the files that have been seized are outside the areas outlined in the warrant, then it was broader than that as a simple matter of logic.
* Cases the judge has printed off for reference.
* Judge: There's still a facial attack on the warrant.
  * Judge: I have dismissed only the subfacial attack on the warrant
  * Defense: We need some clarification on you ruling. 
  * Judge: Your arguments were entirely subfacial...
  * Defense: If we had the benefit of seeing what sections of the warrant...
  * Defense: If the order as it was issued has been found valid, with all the things the search...
  * Judge: Yes... That ruling is a long time coming...
  * Defense: Co-conspirators was both a facial and subfacial attack. ... It is important to know if all the points were
  * Judge: Perhaps I misunderstood what you were seeking. My understanding was that the remedy you were seeking was to quash the warrant, and not to split off certain grounds searching. I didn't need to decide on particular points, because I was only determining if the warrant should have been issued on any grounds. That would be a facial attack, a different remedy.
  * Defense: ...
  * Judge: I understood you were moving to quash the motion. No in the alternative, remedy it.
  * Prosecution: My understanding was that if particular points were found flawed, that would have needed to be addressed. I think it is important to not get bogged down in subfacial vs facial. I think part of the complication is that a lot of the defense's facial attacks derive from subfacial issues.
