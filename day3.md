Byron's Trial, Day 3
====================

(Fire alarm take 40 min)

* Defense: Websites referred to in Affidavit. I just want to highlight that most online sources outline what it is (which helps give it credibility). How would Officer French have described topsite in such a paragraph? I think at best it would be "A site I found on the Internet, which has content from another website that I didn't look at." In fairness, there was no such paragraph...
* Officer French's opinion: To the extent that Officer French gives his opinion, he doesn't outline the basis of his opinion. Because the basis is not clear, if one excises the evidence it is based on, it is problematic to figure out what opinion needs to be excised.
* Regarding the Twitter Discussions, as I argued yesterday the issuing Justic didn't have the necessary context and that Officer French lacked expertise. Yet, Officer French suggested, based on it, that Sonne's computers and phones would have evidence of co-conspirators. Where's the evidence? It interesting, they almost seem to be searching for something they already have -- the tweets.
* Evidence of home ownership may provide a basis to search certain things, but only in the context of reasons to search for things which would make it important. For example, it is significant to find proof of ownership in a grow op, but not without evidence of the grow op.
* Expertise of officers is important.
* From Moreli, searching a computer is a heightened level of privacy.
* Not full fair and frank
* "Mr Sonne has been tweeting these people, enlisitng them, and advising them on how to destroy, allowing for violent confrontation." (very approximate quoting at end)
    * We've departed full fair frank and gone to fiction.
* "See, you're assumption is that he's tweeting to this network of people, but you don't have any evidence?" "He posted to the Internet"
* French agreed that they weren't investigating counseling the commission of an indictable offense. 
* Concluding paragraph: "In addition he is putting the safety of officers and the public in grave danger. Mr. Sonne has been using his computer systems and his phones to pass messages on to co-conspirators." -- The only evidence for the second is the tweets, really? From an officer that didn't bother to look at hashtags. -- French continued about preventing imminent danger.  "I believe there is compelling and corroborating language that these items will be found at his home." -- This is the danger of using boilerplate language that isn't backed up.
* "Items relating to living arrangements at Elderwood..." "Valuable information about the proceeds of crime..." "Rental units..." -- It just goes back to the theme of general sloppiness, actually, I'll go a bit farther, reckless.
  * The only evidence French could provide that there would be documents relating to living arrangments and rental units -- Mr. Sonne's drivers licenses says he lives there.
* "Vividly describing how to destroy police videos" -- He clarfied he meant video cameras. Mr. Sonne didn't do anything of the sort. The only thing is the "cable in joint" photo. "Specific plans for disabling these cameras as he has discussed on twitter. He has gone so far as to post photographs..." Loaded language. Not fair frank language. And didn't include the media tracking of cameras tweets.
* "He's discussed the items he has at home to destroy" ratcheting up language, everywhere. Individually not that problematic, but overarching problems.
* Judge: Precedent in which, since an issuing justice didn't call the affidavent back for questioning, that inconsistencies in the warrant were missed by the justice. This could possibly be applied here.
* (Judge and Defense discuss case law. To quash the entire warrant, the Judge must find that it isn't just reckless, as she puts it, give the dense the home run, but is deliberately misleading. Defense needs to look over Colebern case. The officer may have fallen just shy of fraud... That may be enough? And if all that remains are tweets and they're just looking for tree climbing pegs and then nuts and bolts? Really?)
* Defense: French never gave the innocent explanation. Part of a public conversation on the efficacy of the fense.
* French: Waveguide sends out sound waves that can destroy lines of communication permanently.
* Compelling and corroborating evidence that it will be  at his home address -- but never mentions that it was shelved a year prior. And he never discusses using the waveguide for anything.
   * Judge: he discusses what it could be used for in his blog. 
   * Defense: Yes, but that isn't given.
* Concludes: this is a matter of public and officer safety.... cause greivous bodily harm... shows midndset... The structures of the cameras will be his first target.
  * Defense: What is the purpose of this language. You need to sign this document for safety. There's an element of instilling fear. 
  * It's not an exigent cause type warrant, but it has all the language of it.

* Precedent: So subversive of the operating procedure that it should be quashed.
* But even if you find it falling short, and it just comes to looking for tree pegs, then it falls in the residual discretion, and the defense submits that no justice exercising their discretion would sign such a warrant.
* And there is still misalignment of charges. 
* Precedent: Moreli: A child pornography case. Misalignment of "possession" and "accessing"
* Important to avoid pretext search.

Warrant 2
---------

* Mr. Sonne's statements (made without counsel right) is conceded as a charter violation by the Crown and they will not use them. Thus, the cottage searches are excised. The defense still intends to use it in any 24(2) analysis.
* French claims they found explosives
   * They actually found some chemicals that could be combined to make explosives
* There was an object (a thermocouple) that they believed to be detonator
* Nothing was removed from the house until the second warrant. 
* Judge: It's not likely that the second warrant will make or break my decision.
* A number of miscommunications between French, or was it deliberate ratcheting up of the description of what was found at Sonne residence. He claims they have found explosive devices...
* Under the criminal code, possession of a bomb is a criminal offense, but possession of the chemicals to make the bomb is only a crime with intent. So French's ratcheting up is very significant.
* They find a bunch of chemistry books, talk about how they were used to make 
* They talk about the security passes (actually conference passes) clearly implying they were related to G20 passes (Judge agrees).
* Disturbing that he didn't know it was dissambeled.
* Judge: I have a hard time understanding how someone could find the waveguide and not mention that it was in parts. I'm not that disturbed that he didn't ask about the status, given the rush, but I find it very troubling that someone told French it was found but didn't mention that it was only in a bunch of parts.
* "The waveguide was found, did you ask what status it was in found?" "No..."

* The projectile launcher proves that he is actively preparing to commit mischief and damage property. Actually: they saw pictures and Mr. Sonne and asked him and he told them they were at the cottage.

* Judge: Talks about the importance of it being deliberate and misleading rather than just sloppy.
* Defense: Probability that all the sloppiness could have been constantly against Mr. Sonne.
* Judge agrees
* Defense: 
  * And he testified that his wording was intentional.
  * Omission of blog is important and seems deliberate
     * Judge: Disturbing, but it isn't damning in a way that would make it clear he thought "I better not tell the justice"


Prosecution responds:

Plan:
  * Outline law
  * Essence of the law (in his view)
  * page by page comments

 * "There is no question that there are man problems with these ItOs. No questions that there are many mistakes. No question the quality is poor. Things in there that shouldn't be. ... The affiant is not a strong writer. I think a lot of problems arise from -- I realize not everything arises from that -- but I think many problems we are having arises from that."
 * "I will argue that Officer French didn't do anything subversive, let alone so subversive that the warrant should be quashed" (approximate)
 * "Anything erroneous, anything resulting from the charter ... can not be amplified"
 * "I appreciate that the Defense can't shout at the document as a whole, that they need to look at specific wholes to break down a wall... "
 * The test: Is there any evidence suggesting ...
 * At several points the defense has argued that French had a piece of evidence that he should have investigated farther.
 * The onus is on the defense to show things are misleading.
 * Regarding topsite: The onus is on the defense to show that it is not a reliable source. The justice was told what the source was and conclude their own opinion.
   * Judge: unless citing it suggest reliability
   * The warrant is an investigative tool. Not everything needs to be researched...
 * Precedent: "I am seeking only the possibility that the statements could be upheld, that it could be granted on the strength of the remaining statement.
 * It's a low standard. Because its the front end of a investigation
 * I don't see how French could have disregarded such evidence (topsite)
 *Judge and prosecution discuss onus. Judge: If I find that there wasn't general good-faith, the onus falls on you with any particular detail.
 * Amplification would only come into play if enough is excised that we need it.
 * What are the guts of the argument? The essence is:
   * The flickr account and twitter material carry all the weight.
   * Even if you find you agree with the defense assessment of events with Mr. Sonne's detention, there is circumstantial evidence suggesting they could go without ...
   * Pictures: police officers, US embassy... potential projectiles, potential firing mechanism... and what can be taken, at its lightest, is an apparent projectile launcher.
     * This is the meat of the argument
   * The things he was suggesting, and doing on the Internet...
   * Two branches of amplification:
     * Something gets excised and something is brounght in to fill its place
     * Another type, a principle from a case in the BC court of appeal. The defense attacks the affiant, and  it backfires and strengthens the case. The defense argued it could be used, but the justice found that to not be the case.
       * Judge: Yes, but you're claiming that its automatic.
       * No, not automatic.
   * Judge: Bad faith at large and bad faith in particular different.
   * Let's go through my friends points:
       * Completed crimes .... between the periods... 
         * It was ongoing, but he was interupted and this is the second
         *"Implicit in the materials Mr. Sonne posted was a threat to destroy the property. Counseling, or at least inviting, people to destroy... was a threat"
         * "Bacon on wheels... uploading threats."
         * "Act of mischief... If someone had followed his advice, he would have been a party. You're as guilty as the guy who commits it."
         * "Any conspiracy related to the above..."
       * Item's to search for 
         * "Dealers" have to go
         * Items related to living arrangements could still be significant with concerns to possession.
           * Judge: Couldn't you get ownership without raiding? For that matter, information about the conspirators.
         * Precedents: What flows from credibility questions? 
         * "Any bad faith doesn't flow from his submission to the issuing justice but from the his cross-examination" (approximate)
       * sound cannon was supposed to be waveguide -- small oversight
       * People are treating the issuing judge like a child
       * Let's suppose you (the judge) come to conclusion that the whole incident was detention and we loose all of that... We just have a suspicious male. Let's look at Mr. Sonne's tweets: he discusses being stopped for j-walking. 
       * Judge: If I don't need to question whether they'd find his tweets if they hadn't met. 
         * Prosecution: You don't need to retrace the investigation. Mr. Sonne's tweets were already being investigated.
            * His tweet later on can't be fruit of the poisoned tree.
            * Judge: I think you're implicitly relying on the identity.
            * Judge: One could argue that the suspicious male is misleading if you haven't linked it
       * I can't save the surveillance.
       * Judge (regarding tweet about right violation): "It wouldn't have been there but for..." Prosecution: "But it is in there."
       * Prosecution: Discussion about getting image before detention.
       * Judge: "Can I amplify something that is a deliberate charter breach?"
       * Prosecution: surveillance wouldn't have happened, but for charter violation.
       * par6: "Can someone give me a picture..." is not a misquote, just a partial quote. 
           * Judge: Two different barriers
           * He's getting closer to the fence.
           * The partial quotation is accurate.
           * Judge: He seems to mix the line and fence line
           * As a police officer, I'm sure he understood the difference.
           * The important thing is that he was trying to get closer to the fence.
              * This shouldn't be an exercise in sentence construction.
