Byron Sonne Trial Notes
=======================

If one is to believe the Prosecution and Police, Byron Sonne is a dangerous terrorist, though his exact plan seems to change every week. I think it is fairly evident, to a science-clueful and unbiased person, that Byron, a [CISSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Information_Systems_Security_Professional), licensed Private Investigator, and member of [hacklab.to](http://hacklab.to/), would be more accurately described as a science and security enthusiast.

Take, for example, the explosives charge. It was initially claimed that the police had found an explosive and detonator at Byron's house. The detonator? A [thermocouple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple), a component used to measure temperature -- essentially a thermometer. The explosive? This quickly became a chemistry lab that could be used to make an explosive.

> Bui: "But combined those could make a bomb?"
>
> Byron: "Yeah, but so could your car and a match."

Another example is Byron's Waveguide, described as the key motivation for the search on Byron's house. Officer French, the author of the affidavit for the search, wrote and later affirmed in testimony that "it can destroy radio waves permanently" -- in the warrant, he went into more detail, explaining that this would be accomplished by it sending out sound waves which would then destroy the radio waves. I find it deeply disturbing that an officer seems to have genuinely believed -- and was successful at getting a warrant by asserting! -- that Byron was going to do what one could describe as deleting part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Regarding the Notes
-------------------

These notes on [Byron Sonne's Trial](http://freebyron.org/index.php/Main_Page) are (primarily) the notes of Christopher Olah.

Please Note that Christopher is:

 * Not a lawyer or legal expert of any kind
 * Biased towards Byron, though trying to be objective in taking notes
 * Can't always hear the proceedings of the trial very well

These notes are provided in good faith but may have mistakes, especially regarding the spelling of names. They were jotted down by Christopher, frantically typing to try and keep up with the trial, with some minor spelling and grammar corrections since.

**Feel free to fork and add additional notes, or correct the numerous grammar/spelling mistakes.**

**Byron's [preliminary inquiry](http://info.lawyershop.ca/criminal/index.php/archives/2009/06/12/the-purpose-of-a-preliminary-inquiry/) was under a [publication ban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_ban). It is not entirely clear to what extent that ban is still in effect, but to be safe nothing regarding that is in this repository at this time.**
