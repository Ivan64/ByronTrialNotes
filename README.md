Byron Sonne Trial Notes
=======================

These notes on [Byron Sonne's Trial](http://freebyron.org/index.php/Main_Page) are (primarily) the notes of Christopher Olah.

Please Note that Christopher is:

 * Not a lawyer or legal expert of any kind
 * Biased towards Byron, though trying to be objective in taking notes
 * Can't always hear the proceedings of the trial very well

These notes are provided in good faith but may have mistakes, especially regarding the spelling of names.

**Feel free to fork and add additional notes, or correct the numerous grammar/spelling mistakes.**

**Byron's [preliminary inquiry](http://info.lawyershop.ca/criminal/index.php/archives/2009/06/12/the-purpose-of-a-preliminary-inquiry/) was under a [publication ban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_ban). It is not entirely clear to what extent that ban is still in effect, but to be safe nothing regarding that is in this repository at this time.**
