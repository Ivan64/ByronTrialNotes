Byron's Trial, Day 2
====================

(Lawyers are working on an agreed statement of fact. Judge is waiting outside courtroom for half hour or so.)
(Byron says his lawyers are anticipating killing the search warrant today.)
(Person with wrong number phones courtroom phone. Very loud ringing.)

(Judge enters)
(Crown asks about color photocopier)

Crown was able to find the police car that Constable Simon used. Crown and Council came to the agreed fact that "One could not see the lights, readily." It could be seen, crown agrees, reflecting off houses.
Defense found notes from Simon saying that he "had the male stand in front of the car".
The Judge read the evidence of all the officers involved in the detention incident and Officer French's testimony.

Judge asks about exhibits. Crown still has them. 

Crown has put together a key to highlight certain sections of evidence. 

Council is satisfied with disclosure and abandons motion.

Council will not pursue the motion to cross examine French. Council accepts augmented transcript: transcript and agreed statement. Crown will argue amplification based on it, and council will argue what arguments it needs to make.

Crown: Byron had already attracted open source attention which was traced back to his identity... But that was triggered by detention.

Council: One other point, the evidentiary record on the computer search includes the testimony of Officer Roulet.

Council: I will start Garofoli argument with the original warrant and then proceed forwards. The computer search can be argued separately.

Crown: We're not bringing arguments regarding the cottages and is abandoning them.

Council: The cottages may be relevant to big picture 24(2) analysis, however.

Council: With that said, let's proceed to the Garofoli issue.

Council: The warrant for Mr. Sonne's home is fatally flawed in a number of ways. Broad categories:

  * Once the process of excision occurs, taking into account what I submit are false or misleading conclusions, conjecture and speculation, even simple errors and emissions. Once all of those are accounted for, there remains no basis on which the issuing justice could have issued the warrant. My friend will argue that this is a piecemeal criticism, but when the document is largely misleading that is a constitutional problem.
    * Turning our attention to the actual warrant:
      * This is the actual warrant itself, that stands as a judicial order until such a time as this court may find that it could not have been issued.
      * The warrant in this case is standard section ___ warrant, lists under appendix a to be searched, and section b are crimes that it is reasonable to believe were committed and the items in appendix a were evidence for. There is a _completed_ offense of intimidating a justice system participant, another completed offense of intimidating a justice system participant by watching their workplace, committed offense of mischief, and another completed offense of conspiracy (I say completed because the dates are clearly completed, although the language allows for expected offenses). I believe this is a key start for the analysis because the information to obtain must show clear and probably grounds the at the offenses listed have been committed and evidence will be found at the search.
     * The warrant can't be amplified, it's a court order ??
     * The offense in the warrant must be connected to the ones found in the search. This intended to avoid pretext searches.
     * There is, in my respectful submission, a recklessness to the judicial process. There is indifference to judicial process -- this should prevent the amplification of evidence, since there is case law regarding amplification not being used to avoid 
     * Officer French was at least somewhat familiar with the warrant process. He is familiar with the fact that it should be Full, Fair, and Frank. He knows he needs to present counter-arguments. He understands that there will not be council to test his claims and that it is important to be fair to the issuing justice. It's clear that he had lots of time for the first one, though there may be a second one. He doesn't take the position that he was rushed, but that had time. He agreed that in his choice of language was designed to paint a picture to the judge -- that adds a degree of deliberation to the conduct.
     * Now, Appendix A in the warrant, items to be searched for:
       * The items listed are important, not only in that they demonstrate a slipshot nature on the part of the officer, but that a lot of them are from a drug warrant. His refusal to admit this, when it is painfully obvious, is not only misleading to the Justice, but highlights his mind set and that he's a dangerous applicant. I submit that the obvious answer is that he should have admitted that is was boiler plate that slipped through.
       * Judge: Suppose I accept that, then..?
       * Council: He should not be considered credible, because he was clearly being misleading. Amplification usually follows from assuming the good faith of witness.
       * Judge: Should I conclude general recklessness based on a point by point analysis?
       * Council: It doesn't taint everything, but it needs to be understood that he has been reckless. My friend might argue that on this particular point it's safe to conclude good faith. But I might argue that, because of his general recklessness...
       * Judge: He does give an explanation...
       * Council: "Dealers, people he was having dealings with". [Context: Warrant refers to Mr. Sonne's dealers. This is French's explanation. Council probably used this as an example when bringing up it being painfully obvious that it was content that slipped through, but I didn't write it down at the time.]  Combined with other language, it is clear what he meant. And he stands by this and clarifies this several times, even after a weekend break. 
       * The first item listed items regarding coconspirators and the second is items related to the ownership and living relationship 
       * Other items: bolts, video cameras, items to be used for disruptive purposes, Items to be used to disrupt communication (in particular, an item called a waveguide).
     * The "Grounds to believe that the main offenses are being committed"
       * Paragraphs are 1a, 1a, and 1c. [In (a), ??] Solely typographical issues.
       * No mention of constable Simon
       * Paragraph 1 says officer reviewed the notes of Officer Wang and Simon and learned the following...
       * There's a mention of jay-walking, but that wasn't in the notes.
         * it turns out that that was in a mention by an email from a fellow from a guy name Hassel. 
         * Sloppy.
       * Paragraphs 2: surveillance wouldn't have happened if not for Mr. Sonne being stopped. There is no evidence before the issuing judge or this court suggesting otherwise.
       * Besides noting that the name of the twitter account is "twitter.com/torontogoat blsonne", there is no explanation in this report that links it to Mr. Sonne.
       * Report of July Ban, the other intelligence bulletin, the thin one. Officer French had this document notes that it is a follow up investigation of the torontogoat twitter account. In regards to the torontogoat twitter user, is suspected to be Byron Sonne. Further open source search lead to the user being suspected to be Byron Sonne (date of birth, driver license number) -- ___ is continuing to identify the identity of Sonne, and investigating his intent towards the G20.
       * Page 9, par 16: Notes that he's read July Ban report. French writes "this document identifies the owner of the torontogoat account as Mr. Sonne. Surveillance has confirmed that he lives at  <Elderwood drive house, telephone number>.
          * Turning what the report said into this is shading and a misstatement.
          * Not full, fair and frank.
          * Without the luxury of this report, Justice Marshall wouldn't have anyway of knowing.
       * Twitter activity is public. You can see who is following a person's tweets. You'd be able to discern a conversation. 
         * Partial statement, with out context, correlated tweets
         * Officer didn't provide context
         * There were tweets that are telling omissions
         * If you tell a justice these tweets show something and didn't provide context.
         * An affiant can't just pick and choose
         * Consider the difference between "I killed her" and "The police say I killed her"
         * They're asking for evidence of coconspirators. But they didn't look at who's following. You might get handles or real names, but you'd have tools to say there are conspirators.
            * By failing to investigate or calling for investigation, the affiant has circumscribed the evidentiary basis for the judge to evaluate on.
         * "Post picture of the pass that would get them behind the G20 line" is misleading. French continued that he believes it related to getting into the secure zone. 
               * actually : "Could someone who is a resident or works in the G20 post a picture of the pass that will get them behind the line"
               * May not be a home run, but its a hit.
               * Council had French talk about the zones. Surely, it would have been useful for Justice Marshell to know that there was an outer perimeter zone (which was open to everyone who lived or worked inside) and two interior ones.
               * Judge: He may not have known about the different security zones.
               * Council: If he hadn't known, I'd submit that as someone investigating someone he believes was trying to forge passes, ought to have known. He was certainly around people who would have known.
               * Judge: Not full fair frank, but possibly not out right misleading (approximate wording)
          * Affidavit talks about pictures of photos on surveillance camera
          * On page 9, this is describes it as, in his opinion, "intelligence gathering".
          * Page 8, par 13: No lawful reason for releasing these photos, etc is very troubling.
          * The picture he references as saying cameras are easy to tamper with is a picture of a cable burried in concrete with "cable in joint" beside. And he didn't include a picture.
          * Waveguide and potato cannon were important in ITO 
            * Thee is an entire absence of evidence of that it was Elderwood or even in Mr. Sonne's possession
            * Evidence: picture of it, what seems to be part of it, boards wit shallot , etc all without captions -- and these were out of 260 photos. Certainly, not everything in the photos was in his possession, and we hope the police officers weren't in his possession. It takes a lot more to show that something was in your possession, but presently is. Certain types of pictures, like a picture with him holding it in front of his house would show more. But that's not what we see.
            * these are "items used for the destruction of public property"?
            * "Who I believe is currently in possession of a sound cannon and projectile launcher" for the purpose of destroying.
          * Leslie Night document: first comment: It was uploaded Mach 1st 2010, but we don't know when it was uploaded or where the photo was taken. Additionaly, there are photos of what may be an improvised launcher, possibly CO₂ powered.
          * Not, "In addition there is an improvised launcher, capable of shooting projectiles... Although the affidavit can not comment on its operation, it seems to be in working order"
          * Officer French notes sharp metal objects (ie screw and nuts) and believes, based on twitter, that they are intended to be fired.


(Lunch)

 * Case law
   * Araho: Justice Lebell (Book of authorities, vol 1, tab 10). This in the context of wiretapping, but it has been applied more generally by Justice Watt, "but the authorizing judge must look with attention at the authorizing material with an awareness that constitutional rights are at stake"
    * Whenever his opinion is not backed up by evidence, it should be ignored.
    * "Residual discretion" to dismiss, even where there is bare compliance with the code (in precedent).
  * Returning to the affidavit...
    * Dealing with the context of the pictures, on page 7 of the ITO. The first 3 pages do not have date or captions, while the balance do. 
    * Placing the images together like that creates a message.
    * Looking to the complete print off of Flickr. There are a large variety of objects, spaced by days apart, including the nuts and dry wall plugs, and it isn't until March 1st that we see the potato cannon.
    * So the inference that the nuts and bolts  were to be fired out of the potato cannon depends on context. In the affidavit, he extracted a subset though he maintained order, and didn't provide dates. 
    * He makes these claims without understanding what can be fired, solely based o them both being in the Flickr stream.
    * The joint intelligence report wasn't bound by "full fair and frank" but they still took a much more mild comment.
    * Judge: Surely a he shouldn't need to do further research beyond something he sites?
    * Judge: Isn't it too much of a onus on the affiant to need to mention that the photos were spaced apart?
    * Given the dates, I submit there is no connection between the projectiles or a current possession of that item, and certainly no link to the house.
    * pg 93: The last post you have with regard to the wave guide is 1 year prior. Yes. There is nothing that suggests he's still in possession of the wave guide. That can't suffice as grounds.
    * You agree with me that there is no further posts about the wave guide or improvised launcher? Yes. And there's nothing suggesting where it is? On a desk. But beyond that? Nothing like "launcher in my garage"?  no.
    * Two pictures of police officers taken at the American Embassy (captioned: "stationary bacon"), and on bikes ("bacon on wheels")
    * "Mr. Sonne has taken every opportunity, and at some points succeeded, in taking photos of police officers, at their divisions and assigned posts -- al this based on 4 photos.
      * This is the language of harassment
      * Wasn't sure if university avenue is a division. Clearly misleading...
      * He agrees the language is trying to convey a view. 
      * "And posted them on Flickr, a website that can literally be viewed by anyone"
      * "In addition, he is attempting to obtain passes and uses tactics to break through security lines... enabling him and those working with him to break into restricted area causing fear... and harm." 
      * "there is no other lawfull reason..."
      * These are statements of fact, not opinions
      * Blends opinion & facts and restates them without differentiating between them. 
      * He talks about "those working with him to break in"
      * It's a troubling paragraph
    * par 17, couple minor points:
      * one of the items being searched for is weapons
      * you don't tell the judge he's licensed to have weapons? You don't tell the judge he hasn't registered any?
       * In another affidavit that was otherwise good, this might be a slip, but these add up
      * Similarly, doesn't mention CISSIP certification
    * Par 19, a startling example
      * Mr Sonne's visits to plastic world and Tucker's pottery supplies are disturbing
      * The cross-examination of the officer is about as close to laughable as you'll get in a courtroom. 
        * He's never seen a G20 security pass
        * Doesn't know what's in the stores.
        * "What does he do, when confronted? I would submit he lies. He makes it up in front of Justice Basil."
        * Judge: Is it speculation or lying?
        * He claims text. He's making stuff up. How could he possibly say what the necessary supplies? He doesn't know? He says plastic, and knives. 
        * Judge talks about whether its a lie and talks about it being difficult to say. It's contextually obvious that what he's says is not true, so it isn't really a lie.
        * Defense: I'm not arguing that Officer French committed perjury.
        * Judge: The comment about the stores is troubling, but the comment suggesting Mr. Sonne tweeted about forging passes is more disturbing.
        * Defense: And there are lawful reasons to want to see it.
        * Judge: Yes, but French's position would be that its the cumulative analysis.
        * French says, "these are the twitters that were sent by Byron Sonne, they are noted below and appear exactly as typed by Mr. Sonne" But they're edited in that not all of them are there.
        * We don't take the position that all of them needed to be submitted -- it makes sense to remove the purely irrelevant ones. But some should have been there:
           *For example, why not include the one about media organizations mapping out the cameras.
              * Surely that would be of interest to a justice, since he's very interested in the cameras being publicly posted.
              * Also shows that Mr. Sonne didn't need to gather this information for intelligence purposes -- the media had done it for him
        * The tweets include comments by the officer.
              * For example, the tweet about some cameras being vulnerable linking the cable in joint comment. This is commented as "directly referring to  his plans to interfere" (approximation)
              * "This comment details the time and effort put into he put into ..."
        * "Obviously edit out your details so you don't get in trouble" -- comment: "Indicating criminal intent"
           * Where does criminal intent come from?
           * This is another example of editorializing.
        * "Fuck the Tamils ..." tweet is included, doesn't have a date, one of the very few that doesn't. 
           * It was on the date that the Tamils occupied the Gardener.
           * Why is it in there? Why this over the star posting about the security cameras?
           * French's Comment: "shows distaste for people of ethical origin"
        * Why did French pick these? He claimed:
           * These were ones where he had surveillance showing where Sonne was at the time of tweeting. This can't be true, since that one was a year ago.
           * Then, that they were the relevant ones. But this doesn't seem to be the case.
        * "Practice good security culture" tweet included but "security culture definition" seconds later not included.
        * Includes tweet explaining the fence problems, but nothing linking it to the claims that no one could get by the fence.
        * The tweets are part of a conversation. But he's taking out of a context. And its concerning that he didn't even investigate it.
        * Judge: How far does the onus of the investigating officer go?
        * Defense: click on the hashtag and you can see the conversation in real time.
        * It's unfair to not even mention it to a judge.

     * The waveguide:
        * The word waveguide appears no where on Mr. Sonne's
          * It's not in the captions, etc
          * It's not in the Louise Night Report, but the very last part includes a link to Byron's blog, torontogoat.blogspot.com
             * But the blog is never referred to in the affidavit
             * And the blog hasn't been updated since 2009. Waveguide photos are from back then, as well.
             * The officer admits that he reviewd the blog in preparing the affidavit, though you can't tell that from teh affidavit.
          * Blog post title "No magnetron death ray"
             * "Nothing, maybe a little heat.
             * Inexorably, I have concluded turning a microwave into a death ray is not a simple matter. I'm putting the rig away and if I have some ideas I can try. But the idea is faltlined.
          * What gets _translated_ from the blog is very different from the blog.
          * Affidavit says sonne completed his waveguide. (Judge agrees this implies it works.)
          * How could you think it fair to not include this in the affidavit.
          * Content from wikipedia.
          * Judge: I was at a conference on technology where we were taught that Wikipedia is more reliable that Encylopedia Britanica.
          * Content from topsite citing another site source. 
            * Double hearsay from a source of unknown reliability.
          * It's unfair of the prosecution to try and put the onus on the Defense to show that the information isn't reliable.
          * This website it cut and paste from a website, without quotes. He attributes the website, but it is double hearsay and misleading.
          * Judge: the wikipedia article doesn't mention any nefarious uses of a wave guide.
          * "Even an idiot can make it work"... from the double hearsay source.
          * This is the type of the misleading that (precedents refer to), the type of misleading where one should throw it out.
          * In the second affidavit, he says its the key piece of evidence... And he never asked about it in the results of the search (they found it disassembled in a box).
          * "It can destroy radio waves permanently" !!!
          * "There is compelling and corroborating evidence that he will have it at his home address."
          * "He has talked openly about disrupting cameras and telecommunication devices..."
